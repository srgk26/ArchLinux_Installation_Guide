# ArchLinux_Installation_Guide

This is a very customised and personalised Arch Linux installation workthrough that could be useful for anyone considering to use the Arch Linux distribution. Full installation instructions are in: https://github.com/srgk26/ArchLinux_Installation_Guide/wiki

Arch Linux is well-known to be one of the least user-friendly Linux distributions, with Linux itself considered to be less user-friendly than either Windows or Mac OS X. I would argue, that it is not as user-friendly for a reason: Arch Linux does not shy away from exposing the intricate details involved in the computing process. Easy-to-use operating systems generally mean additional bloatware and processing overhead that slows down performance by introducing layers of designs and abstractions to "hide" the complexity that occurs underneath. While writing lines of code to perform the simplest of tasks is definitely not ideal, sometimes a few words in the command line grants the user a much fuller control over the computer. While much of the repetitive work is still automated, the user would be in charge of giving commands to the computer, rather than the computer taking much of the control.

An inevitable compromise would be a slightly steeper learning curve in the beginning, nevertheless awaiting a more fulfilling computing experience at the end of the road.

This tutorial is compiled from a wide variety of sources, mixing with it my personal touch in building my Arch Linux system. This would be of benefit for some, exposing you to a probably more personalised installation experience as opposed to a more generalised, plain installation. I have also provided some potentially useful user tips in using Arch Linux.

For current Linux users of other distributions, this process would be much simpler for you, though you may still find Arch Linux installation a bit more daunting at first if you are used to the GUI installation setups to install your Linux distributions. Nonetheless, these installation instructions would apply to you as well.

Good luck!
